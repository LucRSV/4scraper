# 4scraper
## A 4chan thread scraper designed to pull Webms from /wsg/ and /gif/ threads

Currently, this project is in its absolute infancy. While it works on MY computer, it may not work on yours. At this time, the default output to MPV works but with no forward/backward movement between the URLs provided. Further MPV control handling will need to be added along with a lot of code clean-up. 

**Requirements:**
All requirements should be met with the default python 3.5 libraries. 

**Flags:**

- -o - Output - [mpv|print|write\*]
- -b - Board - any 4chan board code (wsg, gif, etc.)
- -f - Flag - flag to pass to MPV

\* May not work properly
